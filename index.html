                        <br>Injera is not mostly for his breathtaking speed in open space that has seen him become Kenya's all time try scorer in the IRB circuit. But he also possesses a devastating handoff that often sends opposing tacklers tumbling.

                        <br>Kayange was named by legendary New Zealand coach Gordon Tietjens as one of the best sevens players in the world. His height at 6'6" makes him priceless in lineouts and in recovering kickoffs, both of which he does with aplomb</p>

                        <br>Amonde weighing at over 100kg, Amonde is the battering ram of the Kenya team but is also adept at creating step with a sidestep and a quick pass. Amonde started rugby at Kisumu Boys high school before joining Kisumu RFC and later KCB. </p>

                        <br>Ayange is one player who can play any position in sevens. He is a good distributor. Has an amazing burst of speed which often leaves defenders for dead. And has enough strength to play in the scrum.</p>

                        <br>Adema can feature at both scrum half and centre. He has good speed. But one of the less discussed components of his game is his ability as a cover tackler which is brilliant. Perhaps the best sweeper in the Kenyan team over the past few years.</p>

                        <br>Asego is another highly experienced player having made his IRB sevens debut in 2008. He is possibly the best playmaker ever to don the Kenya jersey. His ability to find open spaces and release team-mates for easy tries has been a key component of Kenya's game in the past 5 years. He is also an excellent place kicker.</p>

                        <br>School Attended: Bungoma High
                        <br>Wanjala saw more playing time at scrum half than anyone else during the 2013 season. He has an excellent work rate.
